# Groop Think

Example multiplayer party game built with Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO and jQuery. A personal boilerplate for prototyping browser based party game ideas that can be sufficiently implemented using familiar js based web-stacks.

### How to play

* Create a room and invite some humans
* Be prompted with an opinionated question that all your humans must answer
* Pick the answer that you think will be the most popular
* Win points and gloat to your fellow humans
